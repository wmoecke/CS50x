Characterizing a person's audio aura by looking at the average energy, valence, and danceability would be like:
SELECT AVG(energy), AVG(danceability), AVG(valence) FROM songs;

However, I think the best way would be to calculate the percentages between the AVERAGE and MAX values for energy, valence, and danceability:
SELECT AVG(energy) * 100.0 / (SELECT MAX(energy) FROM songs) AS perc_energy,
       AVG(danceability) * 100.0 / (SELECT MAX(danceability) FROM songs) AS perc_danceability,
       AVG(valence) * 100.0 / (SELECT MAX(valence) FROM songs) AS perc_valence
FROM songs;
