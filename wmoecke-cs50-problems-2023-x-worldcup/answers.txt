Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
The following predictions were inaccurate: 10, 100, 1000, 10000.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
After 100000 the predictions were consistent.
